I don't know you but I'm a big fan of memory games and Game of Thrones🔥 (house Lannister🦁, of course). 

This is a classic matching game that require players to match similar elements, in this case characters of Game of Thrones. Each person turns over two cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using their memory. Participants need to find a match in less than 12 turns. If you do that... we have a Winner!🙌
